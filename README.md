### IDEA

The first idea does not use mobility data, nor interventions, nor covid data in general. It only analyses the Wikipedia page views and tries to find subjects that receive attention simultaneously to associate them. It will become interesting if subjects which are on the surface unrelated receive simultaneous attention. The results should be output as temporal clusters of topics where for each cluster a list of associated topics as well as a timestamp which indicate when the surge of interest happened. The more difficult part will be to explain these association and decide if they are correlated or just coincidence. The analysis should probably only be done on a country level as it is unlikely that there is correlation if two subjects receive attention but in two different countries.

### FEEDBACK

Idea 1 is neat! Very interesting way to use the dataset! Note that Wikipedia languages are not tightly coupled with countries (some languages have a more one-to-one relationship with a country than other languages). It might be difficult to isolate countries/cultures when you consider that a language-specific Wikipedia article can be read from all around the globe
