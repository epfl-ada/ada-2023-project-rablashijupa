### IDEA

1) The first idea does not use mobility data, nor interventions, nor covid data in general. It only analyses the Wikipedia page views and tries to find subjects that receive attention simultaneously to associate them. It will become interesting if subjects which are on the surface unrelated receive simultaneous attention. The results should be output as temporal clusters of topics where for each cluster a list of associated topics as well as a timestamp which indicate when the surge of interest happened. The more difficult part will be to explain these association and decide if they are correlated or just coincidence. The analysis should probably only be done on a country level as it is unlikely that there is correlation if two subjects receive attention but in two different countries.

2) ...

3) The idea is to characterize countries or languages, as it is the only data available. and interests in topics on Wikipedia. Also plot the interest on a timeline to view the evolution of interests in different topics in each country. Possibly draw some correlation between countries: Which countries seem to follow similar interestsâ€™ trends or which countries do not correlate at all. The idea is to characterize culturally each country based on their Wikipedia interests. This is biased as the people who read Wikipedia is often only a biased minority of a country but keeping that in mind, it could show interesting correlation patterns.

### FEEDBACK

Idea ~1~ 3 is neat! Very interesting way to use the dataset! Note that Wikipedia languages are not tightly coupled with countries (some languages have a more one-to-one relationship with a country than other languages). It might be difficult to isolate countries/cultures when you consider that a language-specific Wikipedia article can be read from all around the globe

### RESEARCH QUESTION

- Which countries are culturally related according to wikipedia page views?

### ADDITIONAL DATASETS

None

Idea 1: Social media and self-education practices in crisis period

Based on the assumption that people spent more time on social networks during the Covid period, with fewer real social contacts, it would be interesting to understand whether the increased time people spent on social media platforms influenced the type of information they were interested in and shaped their points of interest. The goal would be to study the evolution of their centers of interest and see if there is a correlation between what they see on social networks and their educational practices. The project operates under the assumption that people use platforms like Wikipedia for self-education as it is a digital encyclopedia. To achieve this, the project will analyze a dataset of tweets (https://osf.io/qj7c3/?view_only=2df72913b52a4aa792d8391a06d5b7d3) from various regions during the Covid period and explore potential correlations with the topics retrieved in these tweets through sentiment analysis and educational practices on Wikipedia (page views on article with related topics).

Idea 2: Covid-19 as an instrumental variable 

Monks are known to be very thoughtful people, with a keen eye for philosophy and personal development. Is it their deprivation of certain social practices that is linked to this way of life? During Covid, everyone has been able to experience certain aspects of this life being cut off from the world in some way. Is there a link between movement deprivation and personal development, questioning and people's interest in philosophy? We could classify a number of articles on philosophical or personal development topics and study their click rate. We could then see whether the countries with the most severe deprivation policies are the ones where people are most interested in these subjects. We could also study how long people's interest in these subjects persists after the end of covid. All in all, the goal would be to use Covid 19 as an instrumental variable to study the causal relationship between deprivation of certain human contacts and people's interest in personal development and self-reflection.
